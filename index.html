    h1-should websites be responsible for their users posts? 
      p1- I feel that commonly most websites do in fact censor, however, i feel like it isn't for the same reasons. I feel that these websites should not be held liable for what other people post though, while they may be giving them an outlet to share this information they should not be responsible for what is said. It is not their fault as to what the user says and the cannot control everything.
